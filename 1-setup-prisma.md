# 1. Set up Prisma

## Goal

The goal of this lesson is to set up Prisma, get comfortable with Prisma's data modeling language and create some collections in your MongoDB database.

## Setup

First, clone the [starter project from GitHub](https://github.com/nikolasburk/prisma-mongodb-workshop) by following the instructions in the README. Once you've got the starter project on your machine, you can move on and create the MongoDB collections you need for this lesson.

## Tasks

Once you cloned the repo and installed the npm dependencies, you're ready to get started on the tasks of this lesson ðŸ’ª

### Task 1: Create your first Prisma model

The [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema) (typically called `schema.prisma`) file sits at the core of every project that uses any of the Prisma tools. You current Prisma schema looks like this:

```jsx
// prisma/schema.prisma

datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb://root:prisma@localhost:27017/prisma-mongo?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

It specifies the database connection to your MongoDB instance file via the `datasource` and indicates that you want to use Prisma Client by specifying the `generator`.

In addition to the data source and generators, the Prisma schema also contains your *Prisma models* which are Prisma's representation of your MongoDB collections. In this case, you'll create your first Prisma model.

Start by creating the following `User` model with the following fields (and choose the data types that feel the most appropriate to you based on the description below):

- `id`: the unique ID of a user-generated by MongoDB (the field in the underlying MongoDB is called `_id`)
- `name`: the name of a user, this field should be *optional* in the database
- `email`: the email address of a user, this field should be *required* and *unique* in the database

Once you're ready, you can compare your result with the solution below.

- Solution
    
    ```graphql
    model User {
      id    String  @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
      name  String?
      email String  @unique
    }
    ```
    

### Task 2: Map your data model to MongoDB

With your first model in place, you are already set to create the corresponding database collection. Scan the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb) to find the Prisma CLI command that helps you apply the data model to the database. Once you've found the command, run it in your terminal.

- Solution
    
    ```bash
    npx prisma db push
    ```
    

### Task 3: Create documents with Prisma Studio

Congratulations, you just created a new database with a collection called `User` using Prisma. Before you move on to the next section, use [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) to create a couple of documents in that collection. Run the following command to open Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Once it's open, create three documents in the `User` table and save them in the database.
